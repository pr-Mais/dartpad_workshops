# DartPad Workshop: add type-safety to Firestore using converters

FlutterFire stands for Flutter + Firebase. It's a collection of plugins and packages to integrate and use Firebase in Flutter applications.

Firestore is a NoSQL real-time database and one of Firebase's most popular products. There's another database option in Firebase, which is the Real-time Database. To understand the difference between them, this is a nice guide to help you decide which one is suitable for your use case.

In this workshop, you will learn how to write effective and type-safe Firestore queries in Flutter, with techniques to serialize the data from and back to Firestore.
