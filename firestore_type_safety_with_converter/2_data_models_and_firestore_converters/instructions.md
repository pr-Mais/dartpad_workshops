# Data models and Firestore converters

> üí° If you get stuck, click on the **‚ÄúShow Solution‚Äù** button below, then run the code to see the final result in this step.

In the previous step, you have seen how dynamic access to properties in a document could be risky.
Let us now add a layer of type-safety!

## Create `Poll` and `Answer` models

Scroll down to `TODO(1)` and follow the instructions in this section.

The poll document has the following structure:

```
pollId
|___ question (String)
|___ answers (List)
|___ users (Map)
```

To represent it as a data model in Dart, you will create a class named `Poll`. This class will have a property matching each field in the Firestore document.

```dart
class Poll {
  /// represents the `question` field.
  final String question;

  /// represents the `answers` field.
  final List<Answer> answers;

  /// represents the `users` field.
  final Map<String, int> users;

  Poll({
    required this.question,
    required this.answers,
    this.users = const {},
  });
}
```

Note how each field has a clear type. It's important to not leave lists and maps without specifying the type of object inside it. In this case, you already know that the `users` map has `String` keys and `int` values. Similarly, each answer could be represented with a new model, as each answer in the list is a map with its own fields.

```dart
class Answer {
  final int id;
  final String text;
  final int votes;

  Answer({
    required this.text,
    required this.id,
    this.votes = 0,
  });
}
```
<!-- Hm, is this part out of order? I might've missed it, but I did not see any mention of vote calculation thus far? Is it in the snippet code already provided to the user? If so, I'd highlighting that section, or ask the user to implement that part themselves. It feels a bit like something that maybe you know about at this point as the author, but something the workshop taker has not yet covered.-->
The `votes` property is not one of the fields stored in the database. Remember where you calculated votes for each answer?
This transformation code can now be included as a property in each answer as well.

## `fromJson` factory constructor

Let us add another constructor to each model.

```dart
// Add it inside `Poll` class.
factory Poll.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic>? data) {
  final users = (data!['users'] ?? {}).cast<String, int>();
  final answers = data['answers']
      .map((answerData) => Answer.fromJson(answerData, users))
      .toList()
      .cast<Answer>();

  return Poll(
    answers: answers,
    question: data['question'],
    users: users,
  );
}

// Add it inside `Answer` class.
factory Answer.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> data, Map<String, int> users) {
  // Votes is the total of users who voted for this answer by its Id.
  // The logic to calculate total votes is now done on the data layer,
  // making the widgets layer clean and separate from logic.

  // Has the list of users been discussed by this point? I might've missed it, 
  // but Step 2 only has us create an object with Question and Answers, no users.
  int votes = 0;

  for (String user in users.keys) {
    if (users[user] == data['id']) {
      votes++;
    }
  }

  return Answer(
    text: data['text'],
    id: data['id'],
    votes: votes,
  );
}
```

<!-- Once again, I feel like a step has been skipped here, since we didn't code up the vote calculation for PollListItem, but rather just used the code that was already in place. -->
The `votes` is now calculated on the fly for each answer, therefore no need for the extra logic in `PollListItem` üòÑ

## `toJson()` instance method

The constructor above instantiates a new object from a Map. This is helpful when reading documents from Firestore, but you also need to write to Firestore, in which case you need to get back a Map representation of each model.

```dart
// Add inside `Poll` class.
Map<String, dynamic> toJson() {
  final answersMap = <Map<String, dynamic>>[];

  for (var answer in answers) {
    answersMap.add(answer.toJson());
  }

  return {
    'question': question,
    'answers': answersMap,
    'users': users,
  };
}

// Add inside `Answer` class.
Map<String, dynamic> toJson() {
  return {
    'text': text,
    'id': id,
  };
}
```

## Put it all together

You're now ready to use the models. In `TODO(2)` & `TODO(3)`, change the list type from `Map<String, dynamic>` to `Poll`.

<!-- maybe avoid the word magical? "Handy" or "useful" instead? You have a great explanation of what's going on below, but magic sometimes scares folks :)  -->
Next, you will use the magical `withConvereter()` method on the collection reference, scroll back to `TODO(4)`, and change it to the following:

```dart
CollectionReference<Poll> get _pollsRef =>
    _firestore.collection('poll').withConverter<Poll>(
          fromFirestore: (snapshot, _) => Poll.fromJson(snapshot.data()),
          toFirestore: (Poll poll, _) => poll.toJson(),
        );
```

Let us talk a bit about what's happening here. The data received from Firestore is a JSON-like, key-value pairs. The method `withConverter()` will take 2 arguments, a fromJson and toJson methods. It will handle transformation of data for you on all the operations done on this reference. For reads, you will get `Poll` instead of `Map`. In writes, you can pass a `Poll` directly without doing any manual pre-processing to convert it to `Map` back again.

So if you want to add a new poll, you would simply do:

```dart
Poll poll = Poll({...});
_pollsRef.add(poll);
```

## Cleaning up `PollListItem`

In the last step on `TODO(5)`, you will go to `PollListItem`, and remove `votes()` method, now that it's a property of `Answer`.
Then read the votes from answer object in `TODO(6)`.

```dart
trailing: Text('Votes: ${answer.votes}'),
```
